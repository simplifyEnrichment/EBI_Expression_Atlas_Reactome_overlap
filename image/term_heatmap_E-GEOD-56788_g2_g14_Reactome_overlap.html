<p><b>Figure 2.</b> Compare clustering results. Top left panel: Similarity heatmap with clusterings from different methods. Bottom left panel: Concordance between clustering methods. The concordance measures how similar two clusterings are. Right panel: The difference score, number of clusters and the block mean of different clusterings.</p>
